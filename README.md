# Jarvis: Intelligent Assistant for Home Automation 
*Controlling  - Automation - Voice Recognition – Text Chatting – Face Detection - Monitoring*

## Objective:
To automate and facilitate the process of controlling machines and other online tasks in smart homes, hospitals, and other places, Also to help blind and deaf people.

## Abstract:
Jarvis is a software program on an embedded system, It controls and monitor your home. You can Interact with it: Using your voice as standalone system (normal mode), Using either voice or text chat by connecting it with a local network and Interact from your desktop, laptop or smart phones (server mode).

## Contribution:
Local server with text chat. Open source application on Github. Customizable and scalable system.

## Results:
Our project divided into three main sections: Server (voice and text interface), Raspberry pi (GPIOs), External circuits.

## Conclusion:
- Accuracy is inversely proportional to the voice speech noise and natural language processing issues. 
- Text chat achieves high performance and speed than the voice recognition.
- Existence of the internet connection makes the system behaves naturally and respond to more question using some APIs.
